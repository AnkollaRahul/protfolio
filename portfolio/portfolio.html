                <h3>Exploring the Feasibility of Generating Hydrogen through Electrolysis</h3>
                <p> Photo Electrolysis is a method for generating hydrogen, a clean and sustainable fuel source, by using light energy to split water
molecules into their constituent parts, hydrogen and oxygen, through an electrochemical reaction. The process involves the use
of a semiconductor material as a photo electrode, which absorbs light energy and converts it into electrical energy, driving the
water-splitting reaction in an electrochemical cell. The resulting hydrogen and oxygen gases can be collected and used for various
applications, such as fuel cells.
